## Redux

- **Wordpress Calypso: Our Approach to Data**

  https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/our-approach-to-data.md

  The team behind Wordpress's new admin panel looks at their migration from emitters to Flux to Redux, and describes how they organize their state tree, use selectors to extract state, run queries with components, and persist their store state through refreshes.

## Video
- **A Digital Media Primer for Geeks Episode 1**

  https://www.xiph.org/video/vid1.shtml

  This first video from Xiph.Org presents the technical foundations of modern digital media via a half-hour firehose of information. One community member called it "a Uni lecture I never got but really wanted."

  The program offers a brief history of digital media, a quick summary of the sampling theorem, and myriad details of low level audio and video characterization and formatting. It's intended for budding geeks looking to get into video coding, as well as the technically curious who want to know more about the media they wrangle for work or play.

- **A Digital Media Primer for Geeks Episode 2**

  https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml

  Continuing the "firehose" tradition of maximum information density, Xiph.Org's second video on digital media explores multiple facets of digital audio signals and how they really behave in the real world.

  Demonstrations of sampling, quantization, bit-depth, and dither explore digital audio behavior on real audio equipment using both modern digital analysis and vintage analog bench equipment... just in case we can't trust those newfangled digital gizmos. You can also download the source code for each demo and try it all for yourself!
