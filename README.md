- **Lisping at JPL**

    http://flownet.com/gat/jpl-lisp.html

    "The situation is particularly ironic because the argument that has been advanced for discarding Lisp in favor of C++ (and now for Java) is that JPL should use "industry best practice." The problem with this argument is twofold: first, we're confusing best practice with standard practice. The two are not the same. And second, we're assuming that best (or even standard) practice is an invariant with respect to the task, that the best way to write a word processor is also the best way to write a spacecacraft control system. It isn't."

    "The pressure to have an opinion on every important topic has incentivized lazy thinking, the consequences of which we feel every day. Only by expanding our intellectual aperture and attacking our own ideas can we wage war on the narcotic of cheap, bumper sticker arguments. As we do, we can identify the intellectual cancers that plague our culture and constrict our worldview."

## General Programming

- **Goodbye, Clean Code**

    https://overreacted.io/goodbye-clean-code/

    'Am I saying that you should write “dirty” code? No. I suggest to think deeply about what you mean when you say “clean” or “dirty”. Do you get a feeling of revolt? Righteousness? Beauty? Elegance? How sure are you that you can name the concrete engineering outcomes corresponding to those qualities? How exactly do they affect the way the code is written and modified?'

      <summary>Notes</summary>

  ## Chapter 1
  - The goal of software design is to reduce and manage complexity
  - Two primary ways to do this are:
    - Make code simpler and more obvious
    - Modular Design: Encapsulate complexity in one area to avoid spreading complexity

- **Product-Centric is Just as Bad as Sales Driven**

    https://itamargilad.com/product-led/

    A common complaint I hear from product folk is that management is too “sales-driven”. It is a common ailment indeed, but I can tell you that the opposite condition, the strictly “product-focused” company, is pretty bad too. Both companies suffer from over-focus and a narrow worldview.

     https://philipwalton.com/articles/idle-until-urgent/

     Provides a good look at common JavaScripe bottlenecks and how to improve them by using an "Idle Until Urgent" strategy whereby tasks are scheduled using `requestIdleCallback` unless they are needed earlier in which case they are evaluated immediately upon being required.

- **Scheduling in React**

     https://philippspiess.com/scheduling-in-react/
     
     Similar to the **Idle Until Urgent** article above, this article digs into some advanced React scheduling features coming down the pipe. A good introduction to the future of some React APIs and a good article to keep tabs on as these scheduler features are developed. 
     

- **The Unseen Performance Cost of CSS-in-JS**

     https://calendar.perfplanet.com/2019/the-unseen-performance-costs-of-css-in-js-in-react-apps/
     
     In this article, I will attempt to demystify the high-level strategies of the most popular CSS-in-JS libraries, discuss the performance issues they may introduce on occasion and finally consider techniques that we can employ to mitigate them.

- **Ubiquity: The Fallacy of Premature Optimization**

    https://ubiquity.acm.org/article.cfm?id=1513451
    
    Randall Hyde argues that optimization is important even when memory and processor double regularly. Trying to do the optimization too early can be a futile time-waster.

## JS Framework Wars

- **What to Expect From Your Framework**

    https://johan.hal.se/wrote/2023/02/17/what-to-expect-from-your-framework/
    
    But come on: we’re living in the 2020s and if you’re not at like 95% “framework does it for you” for things that aren’t business logic, then you’ve lashed yourself to a very bad mast ‒ you’re stuck building rote infrastructure instead of working on your app, likely creating a bunch of nasty attack surfaces along the way. And what are you getting in return? The warm and fuzzy feeling of deciding precisely how your session cookie is stored and encrypted?

- **Things you forgot (or never knew) because of React**

    https://joshcollinsworth.com/blog/antiquated-react

    I don’t think most people using React on a regular basis realize quite how much it’s fallen behind.

- **Anatomy of a Video Game**

     https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Anatomy
      
     While this article is focused on game programming specifically, it's a good exlanantion of how to efficiently schedule rendering and user input using `requestAnimationFrame` to achieve high frame rates. For this reason it's a good read for those using the `requestAnimationFrame` API for other applications.

     https://www.jackfranklin.co.uk/blog/working-with-react-and-the-web-platform/

     This is not an argument against React specifically but rather an argument that the Web platform has introduced many features over the last 5 years or so that render web frameworks unnecessary for many use-cases.

## Video
- **A Digital Media Primer for Geeks Episode 1**

     https://www.xiph.org/video/vid1.shtml

     This first video from Xiph.Org presents the technical foundations of modern digital media via a half-hour firehose of information. One community member called it "a Uni lecture I never got but really wanted."

     The program offers a brief history of digital media, a quick summary of the sampling theorem, and myriad details of low level audio and video characterization and formatting. It's intended for budding geeks looking to get into video coding, as well as the technically curious who want to know more about the media they wrangle for work or play.

- **A Digital Media Primer for Geeks Episode 2**

     https://www.xiph.org/video/vid2.shtml

     Continuing the "firehose" tradition of maximum information density, Xiph.Org's second video on digital media explores multiple facets of digital audio signals and how they really behave in the real world.

     Demonstrations of sampling, quantization, bit-depth, and dither explore digital audio behavior on real audio equipment using both modern digital analysis and vintage analog bench equipment... just in case we can't trust those newfangled digital gizmos. You can also download the source code for each demo and try it all for yourself!
     
 - **Digital Video Introduction**
 
     https://github.com/leandromoreira/digital_video_introduction
     
     A gentle introduction to video technology, although it's aimed at software developers / engineers, we want to make it easy for anyone to learn.

### ToggleSwitches

#### Conventional Wisdom
- Control boolean state
- Switches are for System States (not local)
- Switches should have immediate effect
- Label copy should be obvious (user’s shouldn’t have to flip the switch to discover what it does)
- Labels should describe what the control will do when the switch is on
